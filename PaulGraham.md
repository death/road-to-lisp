# Paul Graham

## When did you first try Lisp seriously, and which Lisp family member was it?

Interlisp in 1983.

## What led you to try Lisp?

I wanted to do AI, and Lisp was said to be the language of it. Within
a couple weeks of learning Lisp I found programming in any other
language unbearably constraining.  (The other options at the time were
C, Pascal, Fortran, PL/1, Basic and APL.)

## Where did your road originate?

Up till then I had programmed mostly in Basic and PL/1.

## How far have you gotten in your study of Lisp?

Far enough to be convinced that any really good language is going to
have to include JMC's 7 axioms, and therefore to be a dialect of Lisp.
There's no evading something so simple.

## What do you think of Lisp so far?

I like Lisp-the-platonic-form, but I don't like a lot of the features
of currently popular dialects.
