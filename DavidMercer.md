## When did you first try Lisp (meaning here and throughout the survey "any member of the Lisp family") seriously, and which Lisp family member was it?

muLisp in 1985...but it was the Microsoft re-branded one, without an
adequate manual, which intensified the teething pain (the MacLisp
extensions helped!)

## What led you to try Lisp?

It syntaxless nature, and the fact that user defined functions
etc. are first class, and the attraction of programs that can write
and modify programs, including themselves.

## If you were trying Lisp out of unhappiness with another language, what was that other language and what did you not like about it, or what were you hoping to find different in Lisp?

I was frustrated with wimpy, non-commercial languages under MS-DOS
2.x, and wanted something balsier, and decided to spend my money on
the only Lisp I could afford (after drooling over lisp from my
reading).

## How far have you gotten in your study of Lisp? (I know, that is hard to measure)

Heh, hard to say, as I'm just coming back into the fold after
wandering in the Perl wilderness for quite some time now.

## What do you think of Lisp so far?

Still very impressed, which is why I've been returning to it lately.
The lack of good, **FREE**, cross platform gui support is what gets me
down the most.
