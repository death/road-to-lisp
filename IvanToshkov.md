## When did you first try Lisp seriously, and which Lisp family member was it?

We used Lisp in two university courses, but I really started to
understand it when I read a copy of SICP in 1997.  I've started with
Scheme and worked on several toy projects.  Recently I've read Paul
Graham's On Lisp, decided to try CL and contrary to my expectations I
loved it!

## What led you to try Lisp?

Mainly SICP.  It's a wonderful book with many good examples.

## Where did your road originate?

I've worked with C, C++ and Java and knew several other languages, but
all except Assembler and Prolog were pretty much from the same class.
Prolog and then Lisp made me see there is much more in the programming
languages field than I thought before.

## How far have you gotten in your study of Lisp?

I've read (and hopefully understood) SICP, On Lisp and several smaller
texts and wrote some toy programs.  I'm looking for an interesting
project to work on :)

## What do you think of Lisp so far?

I like it very much.  This is the best language I've learned.
