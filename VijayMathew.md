## When did you first try Lisp seriously, and which Lisp family member was it?

I first tried Lisp seriously in 2006, when I read
[SICP](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/). I started with Scheme. Then I
moved on to Common Lisp with the help of Paul Graham's [On
Lisp](http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html) and Seibel's [Practical
Common Lisp](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/).

## What led you to try Lisp?

I was searching for the 'best Computer Science book out there' and
came across SICP. That got me seriously started with Lisp.

## What other languages have you been using most?

C, C++, Java, C# and Python. I also program in Erlang and Smalltalk,
whenever I get a chance!,

## How far have you gotten in your study of Lisp?

I have made good progress. The first Scheme environment I tried was
[DrScheme](http://download.plt-scheme.org/drscheme/). Later I created
[my own Scheme system](http://spark.vmathew.in/) based on
[MzScheme](http://www.plt-scheme.org/software/mzscheme/), with
convenient (i.e, for me) interfaces to all the C/C++ libraries I
regularly use. Now I use this 'personalized Lisp' + Emacs to solve
many of my day-to-day programming problems. I also use Common Lisp,
mainly [Clozure CL](http://openmcl.clozure.com/).

## What do you think of Lisp so far?

Lisp is undoubtedly the best language I have ever used. It pioneered
some of the greatest ideas in programming language design (garbage
collection, homoiconicity, first-class functions etc). It is simple,
consistent and is a real joy to work with!
