## When did you first try Lisp seriously, and which Lisp family member was it?

If AppleScript is a "family member", I guess it would be 1993.  No
s-expressions in that language though, so for reasons better kept to
myself, I think the point of no return was September 2000.

## What led you to try Lisp?

I lived in Oslo, Norway.  When the www craze took of, there was this
SGML oldtimer that told me that html was severely broken.  I
vociferously objected, and it took me a few years to see how right he
had been.  Ever since, I've given his advice some extra thought.

## Where did your road originate?

As opposed to most other lispers, I come from higher-level languages
-- dropped out of Cobol classes at a business school, started out with
Hypertalk, AppleScript, javascript and emacs lisp which aren't that
bad, and then downhill from there, through Perl, VBScript, and Java
Server Pages.

Don't know any of those languages well enough to say that they suck.

## How far have you gotten in your study of Lisp?

Academically, closing in on a masters degree - in Real Life, I hope
I'm better than I think I am.

## What do you think of Lisp so far?

It's high level and low level at the same time.  Even if the language
itself is somewhat irregular, I like how the community strives for the
right way of doing things.

I guess I've swallowed the red pill - I have no problem with the
mini-languages such as format or loop, and as long as macros can be
expanded by emacs, I think the are great for abstractions.
