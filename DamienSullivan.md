## When did you first try Lisp seriously, and which Lisp family member was it?

Summer of 2003.  Chez Scheme, soon followed by Common Lisp.

## What led you to try Lisp?

I'm a grad student at Indiana University, so you might think Friedman
would suck me in.  But I haven't taken that course yet.  The real
cause is that I'm a student of Douglas Hofstadter's, and most of the
lab's programs have been written in Common Lisp or Chez Scheme.  In
particular Jim Marshall's Metacat, which I wish to extend, is in Chez
Scheme.  So I had to learn the stuff.  Then, since I became
dissatisfied with the various Scheme implementations I started looking
at Common Lisp.

I've also read Paul Graham's stuff, but that wasn't the primary cause.

## Where did your road originate?

The languages I've learned, in order: BASIC, Pascal, C, Perl, C++,
Haskell, O'Caml.  I use "learned" loosely for the last two.

## How far have you gotten in your study of Lisp?

I've read a lot, and have written teeny programs.

## What do you think of Lisp so far?

At some levels really nice.  I'm taken by the idea of a language being
its own metalanguage and scripting language, and macros, and such.  On
the other hand my software engineering instincts still cry out for
compile-time type-checking, and worry about efficiency -- I know good
Lisp is supposed to be pretty good, but I want to see it myself.  In
terms of what I know, my instinctive ideal would probably still be
O'Caml's attitude and tools maturity with something like Haskell's
syntax and type classes and the libraries of Java or any of the
scripting languages.
