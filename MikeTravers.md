## When did you first try Lisp seriously, and which Lisp family member was it?

I was fortunate enough to be working at MIT's Tech Square when the
first Lisp Machines were being developed.

## What led you to try Lisp?

Curiosity.

## Where did your road originate?

At the time I was programming mainly in PDP-10 assembly language,
which is more fun than it sounds like, but I thought there must be a
better way. I was also attracted to the Lisp Machines since they
actually had graphics capabilities, which I had encountered before (on
the PLATO system) but wasn't readily available in the MIT world.

## How far have you gotten in your study of Lisp?

I've used Lisp extensively for close to 20 years. I'ved done research
projects, hacks, tools, and commercial applications.  So I'd say I
know it pretty well. I've also written my own Scheme implementation,
[Skij](http://alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/Skij).

## What do you think of Lisp so far?

Well, it's a great language, but I'm frustrated that it hasn't
progressed or been improved on much for close to 20 years now.  I'm
interested in the [Road Beyond
Lisp](http://xenia.media.mit.edu/~mt/diss/).
