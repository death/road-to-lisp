## When did you first try Lisp seriously, and which Lisp family member was it?

Summer of 2002. The development environment was PLT's DrScheme.

## What led you to try Lisp?

[Constantine Vetoshev](ConstantineVetoshev.md) suggested I read SICP,
and a year or so later I acted on that suggestion. Right after that,
in fall of 2002 I took a senior-level computer science class called
"Programming Languages Survey" with Professor Robert Dewar at
NYU. Scheme was one of the languages covered, along with Ada, Python
and SNOBOL, and Scheme really seemed the only thing that was really
different from all the other languages. After that, someone suggested
that for real world applications I should write in Lisp, and not
Scheme, so now I am exploring that suggestion.

## How far have you gotten in your study of Lisp?

Still haven't read "On Lisp" by Paul Graham, so really, not that far.

## What do you think of Lisp so far?

It seems like it has much potential to get me to re-learn how to
program correctly. As my main programming language I started out with
Basic, then switched to Pascal, then to C++, then to Java, with things
like VB and Perl and Python on the side, and nothing seems to
satisfy. Maybe this will.
