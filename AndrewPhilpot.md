## When did you first try Lisp seriously, and which Lisp family member was it?

1985, Common Lisp (very early).  I used CL on a Data General MV 8000
and IQLisp on a DOS PC.

## What led you to try Lisp?

It was used in a university course, so I gave it an honest try.  I
found it be very expressive and closer to my way of thinking than
Pascal and Fortran and C, which were the other main options at the
time.  Even at that early age, I believe I showed some aptitude for
it, and I have never considered myself as proficient in any other
language.

## Where did your road originate?

Duke University, Expert Systems course.  (I still own the battered
copy of Winston & Horn v. 1 used therein)

## How far have you gotten in your study of Lisp?

I'm a good solid Lisp programmer.  I am not a standards geek; I know I
often write code that falls far short of perfection, but I generally
can get the job done.

## What do you think of Lisp so far?

The best language I know of.
