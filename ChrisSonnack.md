# Chris Sonnack

I'm Chris Sonnack.  I've been programming since '79 and paid for it
since '88 or so (happened gradually...did a little app for the job,
that gave me visibility for other requests, and eventually it lead
to a formal position).

## What led you to try Lisp?

A recent (forgotten) discussion on comp.programing lead me to once
again think, "Hmmm... Lisp.... Wonder what that's all about."

So I went looking for a download, found LispWorks and spent a very
intense weekend working through a tutorial I found in parallel with
CLtL and the Hyperspec.

By the end of the weekend, I'd created my first Lisp app: that old
standard, the game MasterMind.

## How far have you gotten in your study of Lisp?

I'm working through OnLisp (which I think I'll need to re-read after I
know the language better...seems to require a good knowledge of Lisp
functions) and a few other papers I've picked up.

## What do you think of Lisp so far?

Love at first keypress!  No other language has caused me to laugh out
loud... from sheer delight.  "You can do THAT??  COOL!!"

Just recently started looking into CLOS and--so far--I'm extremely
underwhelmed by Lisp's kludgy, tacked on OOP system.  Might change my
mind once I learn more about it, but so far ... not impressed.
