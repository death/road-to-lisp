# Pekka P Pirinen

## When did you first try Lisp seriously, and which Lisp family member was it?

1983.  ALLL, a specialized Lisp interpreter that was part of a DBMS I
built with some friends (Maclisp-like, with optional parentheses).

## What led you to try Lisp?

Specific recommendation of a friend; joining a project that used Lisp.

## Where did your road originate?

General curiousity about programming languages.

## How far have you gotten in your study of Lisp?

I've worked on Lisp implementations for well over ten years, and I
like language lawyering anyway, so I know the standard, and am
familiar with various internals.

## What do you think of Lisp so far?

It's definitely the best tool for anything that is not pure
bit-twiddling.
