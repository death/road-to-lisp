# Erik Enge

## When did you first try Lisp seriously?

2000.

## Which Lisp did you try?

Franz Allegro Common Lisp and CMUCL.

## What led you to try Lisp?

Erik Naggum's ranting about how great it was on various newsgroups
coupled with a cousin of mine which I respect and look up to who said
he thought it was the language to learn.

## If you were trying Lisp out of unhappiness with another language, what was it and what did you not like about it, or what about Lisp were you hoping to find different?

Well, I suppose since one of the main factors why I did try out Common
Lisp was because Python was insanely slow, I guess I could say I did
not like the slowness of Python and wanted something better.  Of
course, I never expected that Common Lisp would be *that* much better.

## How far have you gotten in your study of Lisp? (I know, that is hard to measure)

I'm on my second reading of the standard.  In other words, still a
novice.

## What do you think of Lisp so far?

It has some onions, as Paul Graham would say, but I love it.
