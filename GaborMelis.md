# Gabor Melis

## When did you first try Lisp (meaning here and throughout the survey "any member of the Lisp family") seriously, and which Lisp family member was it?

It was during my most recent yearly learn-something-new phase (2002)
that I went after the "profound enlightenment" promise. Shortly after,
I began using it for hobby projects and after a few months at work,
too. It was Common Lisp.

## What led you to try Lisp?

Many small things. Becoming less enchanted with statically typed
languages, reading [RtL Douglas
Hofstadter](https://web.archive.org/web/20110929034206/http://wiki.alu.org/RtL%20Douglas%20Hofstadter),
having decided it is worth it to learn Emacs and [RtL Emacs
Elisp](https://web.archive.org/web/20110929034206/http://wiki.alu.org/RtL%20Emacs%20Elisp),
loving [RtL
AI](https://web.archive.org/web/20110929034206/http://wiki.alu.org/RtL%20AI),
knowing about [RtL Greenspun's
Tenth](https://web.archive.org/web/20110929034206/http://wiki.alu.org/RtL%20Greenspun%27s%20Tenth),
a colleague of mine sending me links to CLOS texts and [RtL Paul
Graham](https://web.archive.org/web/20110929034206/http://wiki.alu.org/RtL%20Paul%20Graham)
articles, my habit of saying "Lisp Interpreter" instead of "Turing
Machine" when emphasizing the practical side of things, Eric Raymond's
How to Become a Hacker, learning about Python, implementing CLOS-like
generic functions in a language that didn't have it. It all came
together, finally.

## If you were trying Lisp out of unhappiness with another language, what was that other language and what did you not like about it, or what were you hoping to find different in Lisp?

Yes, partly. It was Java. Its rigidity, the lack of templates, its
resistance to elegant solutions and generally the boredom it causes.

## How far have you gotten in your study of Lisp?

I get the concepts and try to put them into use. But old habits die
hard and Common Lisp is not easy to master.

## What do you think of Lisp so far?

I like its elegance and power, the functional touch, macros, the
various times (read, compile, ...), CLOS. But the best thing is the
confidence it gives in that it can absorb a large amount of change.
