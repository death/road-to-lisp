# When did you first try Lisp (meaning here and throughout the survey "any member of the Lisp family") seriously, and which Lisp family member was it?

Ever since I tortured myself into learning to use Emacs 20.7, I'm
being slowly dragged against my will into learning lisp.  First
started off with elisp, dropped it and then picked up common lisp.

# What led you to try Lisp?

Curiousity and the intensity of individuals speaking up for it on
c.l.l.  Then again, KMP interview on /., Paul Graham's writing and
Erik Naggum's postings on c.l.l.

# If you were trying Lisp out of unhappiness with another language, what was that other language and what did you not like about it, or what were you hoping to find different in Lisp?

So far, it beats other languages I've known in the edit-compile-debug
part. In situ evaluation of code saves a lot of drudgery while
learning, at least!

# How far have you gotten in your study of Lisp? (I know, that is hard to measure)

Learning lisp is harder than I thought it would be.  Faced with
something intelligently designed, I'm a slow learner. :)

# What do you think of Lisp so far?

Even though I haven't learnt enough lisp yet, I've almost got
religion!
