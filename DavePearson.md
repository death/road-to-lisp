## When did you first try Lisp seriously?

Assuming you mean [Common
Lisp](https://web.archive.org/web/20101108075022/http://wiki.alu.org/Common%20Lisp)
I think it was sometime around 1998 or 1999, although I'd been
dabbling with the language for a while before then.

## Which Lisp did you try?

[Common
Lisp](https://web.archive.org/web/20101108075022/http://wiki.alu.org/Common%20Lisp). Assuming
you meant that anyway and what you're really asking is "which
implementation of [Common
Lisp](https://web.archive.org/web/20101108075022/http://wiki.alu.org/Common%20Lisp)
did you try" the answer would be
[Allegro](https://web.archive.org/web/20101108075022/http://wiki.alu.org/Allegro)
and
[clisp](https://web.archive.org/web/20101108075022/http://wiki.alu.org/clisp).

## What led you to try Lisp?

A desire to play with different languages. On top of that I was quite
an avid [GNU
emacs](https://web.archive.org/web/20101108075022/http://wiki.alu.org/GNU%20emacs)
user and I'd started to dabble with
[elisp](https://web.archive.org/web/20101108075022/http://wiki.alu.org/elisp).
Getting to know
[elisp](https://web.archive.org/web/20101108075022/http://wiki.alu.org/elisp)
then lead me to playing with [Common
Lisp](https://web.archive.org/web/20101108075022/http://wiki.alu.org/Common%20Lisp).

## If you were trying Lisp out of unhappiness with another language, what was it and what did you not like about it, or what about Lisp were you hoping to find different?

If I knew what I was hoping to find that was different I probably
wouldn't have found it different, would I?

## How far have you gotten in your study of Lisp? (I know, that is hard to measure)

I've got far enough to write some code that I'm happy to let the world
see.  I'm not sure that's really a measure of anything but it's the
best measure I can think of.

## What do you think of Lisp so far?

If I were dropped on a desert island and told that I could have only
one programming language to play with it would be [Common
Lisp](https://web.archive.org/web/20101108075022/http://wiki.alu.org/Common%20Lisp).
