## When did you first try Lisp seriously, and which Lisp family member was it?

It was in 1980/81 or so. I bought Allen's book *Anatomy of LISP*. And
tried to get a copy of Lisp for the school computer.  The computer was
an Alpha LSI-2. I think the Lisp was as a port of Lisp 1.5, called
Lisp 1.56 (IIRC). Unfortunately I could not get enough machine time to
try it out properly. But I studied the source code.

Later in 1984 I started University and there we used InterLISP on a
DEC-20.

## What led you to try Lisp?

In 1979 I had an intriguing conversation with someone about Lisp, and
later I read the BYTE articles in their special Lisp issue.

## Where did your road originate?

Z80 Assembler.

## How far have you gotten in your study of Lisp?

I have been at it for some time now, but I don't feel I have
completely mastered Common Lisp.

## What do you think of Lisp so far?

I have at times been dissatisfied with Lisp and gone looking for other
languages. I have been trying Prolog, Modula-3, Python, etc.  But I
haven't found anything that is, on the whole, better than Lisp.  I
have therefor returned to the fold.
