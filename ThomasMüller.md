## When did you first try Lisp seriously, and which Lisp family member was it?

Some months ago (2003), I start to play around with Lisp. First with
CLisp and Allegro now I settled on Corman Lisp.

## What led you to try Lisp?

I read some articles about Genetic Programming, which sounds quite
interesting. When looking for sources and literature, I stumbled about
more and more Lisp.

## Where did your road originate?

I earn my money from programming mostly in Pascal/Delphi since 15
years. In the very beginning of my programming carrer, I had a brief
encounter with GC-Lisp, but found the whole idea why one would like to
program in such a way completely uncomprehensible. Imperative
languages looked like the straight thing, then.  When I tried it again
now, I was really awed by the power and depth of the concepts in Lisp.

## How far have you gotten in your study of Lisp?

Still quite a newbie. I worked through several tutorials found on the
web an currently through Paul Grahams ANSI Commeon Lisp. Sooner or
later I hope to enter a stage where I can use Lisp in serious
projects.

## What do you think of Lisp so far?

Greatest thing so far, it gave me back the fun of programming. I see
an enormous potential in doing things which are of course feasible in
languages like C++, Object-Pascal, Java but with significantly less
man-power and overhead.
