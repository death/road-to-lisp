## When did you first try Lisp seriously?

Define "seriously"?  I read about Lisp in college in the late 1980's
in Douglas Hofstadter's book, Metamagical Themas.  Based on the
"specification" in that book, I wrote a small Lisp interpreter in
Turbo Pascal.  More recently, I read Kent Pitman's interview on
Slashdot in early 2002, and got back into it.

## Which Lisp did you try?

GNU Common Lisp, CMU Common Lisp.

## What led you to try Lisp?

Douglas Hofstadter's [Metamagical
  Themas](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0465045669/ref=pd_bxgy_img_2/104-1563526-3323133?v=glance&s=books).

Kent Pitman's
[interview](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/11/03/1726251) on
Slashdot, and especially this question:

Also, Graham's essay "Beating the Averages" made me dream about
writing Lisp-based server apps (and making lots of money, too
:).

## If you were trying Lisp out of unhappiness with another language, what was it and what did you not like about it, or what about Lisp were you hoping to find different?

I wanted to have fun programming again.

## What other languages did you look at besides Lisp, and what did you think of them?

n/a

## If you had heard bad things about Lisp before trying it, what were those things, from where did you hear them, and why did you try Lisp anyway?

"Lisp is slow".  CMU CL compiles to x86 machine code; when I realized
that, I didn't worry about speed any more, especially given that for
the vast majority of recent coding I'd done, I'd used Perl (not a
crawler, but not compiled to machine code, either).

"You have to use Emacs."  I didn't really "hear this about Lisp", but
lots of people mentioned ILisp, an Emacs add-on module.  I've used
Vi/Vim since 1991, and didn't fancy switching to Emacs.  I had little
confidence that the Vi emulation modes for Emacs would have the
Vi-extentions to which I'd grown accustomed in Vim (though I didn't
actually verify this assumption).  So, I wrote VILisp, which has
suited my needs, at least for the fairly rudimentary stuff I've done
so far.

## How far have you gotten in your study of Lisp? (I know, that is hard to measure)

I've read Graham's On Lisp, and ANSI Common Lisp.  I've fiddled with
some Lisp hacking in off hours, but not done much else.  I've lamented
the "xml is just s-expressions in drag" truism as I've fought with xml
in Java at work.  :-\

## What do you think of Lisp so far?

I like it.
