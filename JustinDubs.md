## When did you first try Lisp seriously, and which Lisp family member was it?

I first seriously tried Lisp during the summer of 2002.  I started
with both CLisp and OpenMCL on my PowerBook G4.

## What led you to try Lisp?

Several things led me to Lisp.  Firstly, I was in the midst of The
Great Language Exploration, during the course of which I experimented
with 30-some odd languages.  Secondly, the languages I'd been using
for personal projects (C++ and Java) left me wanting.  I was fed up
with hacks like the Visitor Pattern designed to work around Java's
broken dispatch system.

## Where did your road originate?

I started off using BASIC on a Commodore 64 back in 1994.  I then
"graduated" to Visual Basic in '96.  After than came C, C++ and x86
Assembler.  I rounded out highschool in '99 by picking up Perl and
Pascal.  With college came free time and many more languages: Python,
SML, Prolog, Forth, Cobol, Java and so forth.  I remained primarily a
C++ and Java programmer until the awakening that was Lisp.

## How far have you gotten in your study of Lisp?

I have yet to write a substantial application in Lisp but I have a
strong theoritical grounding.  I've recently picked up the MOP and
readtables.

## What do you think of Lisp so far?

I love it.  The syntax and theoretical power are truly astounding.
I'm not 100% thrilled with ANSI Common Lisp.  It's my favorite
language thus far, but I still think it could use a rewrite.
