# Ola Rinta-Koski

## When did you first try Lisp seriously, and which Lisp family member was it?

In 1991, with Allegro Common Lisp on SGI or Sun, possibly both - this
was a while ago! I'd done something with Emacs Lisp already in the
late 80's, but not for profit.

## What led you to try Lisp?

Well, I was paid to do so. I was recruited to modify/construct a GUI
for an application already written in CL.

## Where did your road originate?

I've been paid to program in C, C++, Perl and Java, and am also
familiar with PHP, Postscript, Scheme and Pascal. Of course, the real
beginning was BASIC on the Commodore VIC-20 quite some time ago.

## How far have you gotten in your study of Lisp?

Not far enough. I wish I knew more about CLOS than what you can do
also with other OO paradigms.

## What do you think of Lisp so far?

With other programming languages, it's always a case of "how do I
express this problem in terms of this particular subset of
idiosyncracies". With Lisp, developing programs is more a case of "how
do I solve this problem". In other words, it lets you work on the
problem right away.
