## When did you first try Lisp seriously, and which Lisp family member was it?

It was AutoLISP, around 1995. I downloaded some program that did not
work and tried to fix it.

I had never programmed before that so imagine how puzzled I was
looking at all those parenthesis in notepad.

## What led you to try Lisp?

I started with AutoLISP to automate all the boring tasks of designing
and drafting.

## Where did your road originate?

After learning AutoLISP I wanted to do some general purpose
programming so tried Python and C++. They looked too different from
AutoLISP without the parenthesis that I had already learnt to love :).

The search for a new language led me to pick Emacs as editor, then I
found Elisp and later Common Lisp.  I also prefer the community around
comp.lang.lisp than comp.lang.c++ or comp.lang.python.

## How far have you gotten in your study of Lisp?

Not too far. Lisp is a hobby of mine and the learn pace is not too
fast.  I mostly learn by reading comp.lang.lisp and playing with my
lisp powered [server](http://213.97.131.125/lisp).  It uses CMUCL,
mod_lisp and htout. I have a
[cliki](http://213.97.131.125/cliki/Index) there too.

## What do you think of Lisp so far?
