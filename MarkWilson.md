## When did you first try Lisp seriously, and which Lisp family member was it?

Scheme within the past year.

## What led you to try Lisp?

I was learning Ruby (another wonderful language) and wanting to learn
more about computer languages and computing. Scheme helps me
understand Ruby and other programming languages. I do believe that
every computer programmer and many other people should learn Scheme or
another Lisp-like language.

## How far have you gotten in your study of Lisp?

Just book learnin'.

## What do you think of Lisp so far?

It's a wonderful language for thinking clearly about computation,
computability and programming languages generally. Also, several of
the best books that teach programming fundamentals use Scheme (SICP,
How to Design Programs, The Little Schemer, etc.).
