# When did you first try Lisp seriously, and which Lisp family member was it?

Emacs Lisp in 1997, at a summer job. I had used Linux before, and had
heard of the mighty Emacs editor, but hadn't had a chance to use
it. The primary motivation was to try out the Gnus
newsreader. Configuring it meant learning rudimentary Elisp.

Later that year I began reading SICP, as the Helsinki University of
Technology uses it for their first programming course. I was then told
that Common Lisp would be "Scheme's big brother", and that Franz
distributed free trial versions of Allegro CL 4.2. I ordered one, but
never installed it due to technical problems ;-)

# What led you to try Lisp?

The need to configure Emacs and academic self-interest. In the case of
Common Lisp, I had heard of the language, and of the good things it
did, but the final nail was reading Erik Naggum's insightful articles
in comp.lang.scheme.

# Where did your road originate?

I can't really tell; After hacking Elisp and Scheme and reading the
Hyperspec, CL just grew on me.

# How far have you gotten in your study of Lisp?

I'm familiar with most of the concepts, but I haven't had a chance to
properly try them out. Most of my programs haven't reached even the
1000 line limit. I have participated to ICFP 2001, 2002 and 2003
programming contests with a Lisp entry, with varying success and have
also used Lisp in university exercises whenever possible.

Most of my Lisp hacking I just dabble around in the REPL trying out
something I just read in the HyperSpec, like a guitar player
practicing new chords, who hasn't yet written his first proper song ;)

# What do you think of Lisp so far?

It's pretty neat. I wish I could use it at work, but at the moment I'm
just not fluent enough with it to get the orders-of-magnitude boost
people are describing.
