## When did you first try Lisp seriously, and which Lisp family member was it?

I first seriously tried Lisp using MITScheme to work the exercises in
SICP and The Little/Seasoned Schemer.  I am now using OpenMCL to learn
CL.

## What led you to try Lisp?

Although, I have been programming for several years (in the language
that shall not be named.  *No, not that one, the other one.  No, the
other one.  Yes, that one.*), I recently came across a recommendation
of SICP by Jamie Zawinski that was so persuasive that I bought the
book and was blown away from the beginning.  I downloaded MITScheme to
work the exercises and have been digging it ever since.  Also, Kent
Pittman's replies on /. and Paul Graham's articles really inspired me.

## Where did your road originate?

I read Metamagical Themas several years ago and worked through the
examples Douglas Hofstadter gave when discussing Lisp. I thought the
(lack of) syntax was cool and appealed on an intuitive level that I
didn't fully appreciate at the time.

## How far have you gotten in your study of Lisp?

I'm still a newbie and because I have to program in other languages at
work and have a 18 month old at home, I don't get to spend nearly as
much time learning as I would like, but I'm hopeful to learning a lot
more.  (Anyone know of any jobs learning Lisp?)

## What do you think of Lisp so far?

I think it's great in so many ways.  Another thing that I like is how
passionate the Lisp community is about it.  I lurk on c.l.l and enjoy
reading the "advocacy" posts just as much as the technical ones.
