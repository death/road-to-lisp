## When did you first try Lisp seriously, and which Lisp family member was it?

I encountered Lisp through Emacs. I encountered Emacs after having
acquired a UNIX account at the university back in something like 1988.

## What led you to try Lisp?

It is very difficult to be a serious Emacs hacker without being
thoroughly exposed to Lisp. As I tend to get very enthusiastic about
powerfull technology, I took Emacs hacking very seriously and it is
not possible (as far as I know) to actually use Lisp seriously before
reaching the point of no return.

## How far have you gotten in your study of Lisp?

I would rate myself as a competent Lisp programmer. I know my way
around the hyperspec and feel comfortable with all the entries in
table of contents. I have some 8000 lines in my .emacs file and have
even worked professionally with Common Lisp for a couple of years.

I have however still a long way to go. I still need to experiment a
lot in order to get `reduce' to do what I want and I have yet to truly
understand how Henry Bakers META parser works. I also need to write
more code in order to build up my sense of code layout and program
structure.

## What do you think of Lisp so far?

Lisp is the most sophisticated programming language I know. It is
literally decades ahead of the competition.
