## When did you first try Lisp seriously, and which Lisp family member was it?

My first Lisp was P-Lisp running on an Apple IIe with 48k of RAM
around 1980 or so.  It could run the 3-disk Towers of Hanoi problem
(with graphics!).  I went on to use Franz Lisp running on a VAX 11/780
in college, had a brief flirtation with Scheme around that time but
found I couldn't wrap my brain around call/cc.  In 1986 Coral Common
Lisp (now Macintosh Common Lisp) came out.  It was then and is still
today my favorite development environment.

## What led you to try Lisp?

Mainly the fact that it was used for AI, which I was (and still am)
very interested in.  But I've kept using it through the years because
it allows me to be orders of magnitude more productive than any other
language I've tried.

## Where did your road originate?

I went from Basic to Pascal to Lisp.

## How far have you gotten in your study of Lisp?

I'd call myself an expert at this point, though there are certainly
people who know far more about it than I do.  That's one of the
wonderful things about Lisp.  You don't have to be an expert to be
productive in it (like you do in, say, C++) but you never quite reach
the end either.  I think that's because Lisp encompasses all ideas in
programming, both actual and potential.

## What do you think of Lisp so far?

Lisp is far and away my favorite programming language.
