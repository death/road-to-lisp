## When did you first try Lisp seriously, and which Lisp family member was it?

I used Scheme in a ProgrammingLanguagePrinciples class, then ended up
using ACL4 in grad-school.  So stuck by 93.

## What led you to try Lisp?

Classes and needing to get a job done, incl. thesis using OPS5

## What other languages have you been using most?

Started doing simulation in FORTRAN77 in HS. Also use of C(++), and
later Smalltalk, some java.  A fair amount of rule-based OO shells,
incl. CLIPS and the commercial version ART*Enterprise.  Like CLOS and
Lisp(like)KnRep much more than c++/java.

## How far have you gotten in your study of Lisp?

A fair number of years, but always much much more to learn.

## What do you think of Lisp so far?

Wish it was easier to play w/other libraries, and huge amounts of
data.
