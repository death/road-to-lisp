## When did you first try Lisp seriously, and which Lisp family member was it?

1997. Macintosh Common Lisp.

## What led you to try Lisp?

I'd dabbled in Lisp for many years but the kicker was Structure and
Interpretation of Computer Programs and I got there from [Phil
Greenspun](http://philip.greenspun.com/).

## Where did your road originate?

Language wise, from C, C++, Delphi, Visual Basic. Style wise, from
wanting more control and less drudgery.

## How far have you gotten in your study of Lisp?

Hmmm, pretty far I think (though Lisp has a way of remaining fresh and
surprising!).

## What do you think of Lisp so far?

I continue to love it (even with its warts). It makes my work so much
more interesting, fun and productive than any other computer language
I've experienced.
