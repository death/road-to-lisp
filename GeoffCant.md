## When did you first try Lisp seriously, and which Lisp family member was it?

I first tried lisp seriously in early 2003. I first tried Gauche
Scheme before settling on CMUCL.

## What led you to try Lisp?

Curiosity, a large number of hackers I admire use Lisp, sick of using
blecherous languages at university, wanting to use a language for my
fourth year project that wouldn't drive me nuts.

## Where did your road originate?

Emacs Lisp -> Research into lisp machines and Genera -> Wondering why
Lisp on the web largely died out (forests of 404s) -> Scheme -> CMUCL
-> delirious happiness :)

## How far have you gotten in your study of Lisp?

Basic mastry of ASDF, OpenGL and macros.

## What do you think of Lisp so far?

It's the most fun and promising language I've used since (dare I say
it) Perl. Can't wait to write some more lisp :)
