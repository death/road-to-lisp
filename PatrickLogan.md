## When did you first try Lisp (meaning here and throughout the survey "any member of the Lisp family") seriously, and which Lisp family member was it?

I first tried MacLisp during my undergraduate education, more than 20
years ago.

## What led you to try Lisp?

Principles of Programming Languages course.

## If you were trying Lisp out of unhappiness with another language, what was that other language and what did you not like about it, or what were you hoping to find different in Lisp?

N/A

## How far have you gotten in your study of Lisp? (I know, that is hard to measure)

Not a year has gone by when I have not programmed in some version of
Lisp. Mostly Scheme and CommonLisp since early 1980s.

## What do you think of Lisp so far?

So far I think I like it!  8^)
