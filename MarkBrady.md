## When did you first try Lisp seriously, and which Lisp family member was it?

I first tried Lisp seriously last year (2002), but only fully switched
in the last few months. Clisp is my main implementation but I also use
SBCL and Corman Lisp.

## What led you to try Lisp?

I was impressed by the PLT scheme presentation and very impressed by
Paul Grahams talk at LL2. Also I kept trying and learning new
languages but lisp always seemed to have the best way of doing
things. I kept seeing features in other languages and thinking 'lisp
can do that', it just seemed able to handle anything I could throw at
it.

## Where did your road originate?

I had learned python and enjoyed the ability to do cool functional
stuff in it but soon wanted more power. Lisp was exactly what I
wanted. I love squeak smalltalk but sadly it's bit of a mess and
Common Lisp has the same dynamic features but in a more organised and
structured way.

## How far have you gotten in your study of Lisp?

Newbie but coming along well. Can be productive but my code is still
terrible :-) Having said that at the moment I am hacking out a
co-operative fair threads system in userspace for Clisp. It's a 'worse
is better way' of doing things but I think it might still be useful
for many people (if I can get it to work!).

## What do you think of Lisp so far?

It's fantastic. Seems to be getting better every day and the community
is really taking off.
