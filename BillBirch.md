## When did you first try Lisp seriously, and which Lisp family member was it?

I first purchased a Lisp interpreter for the Sinclair QL in
about 1986.  This was a port of Acorn Lisp for the BBC-B Microcomputer
to the QL.

## What led you to try Lisp?

A collegue showed me a Lisp interpreter....

Initially I viewed Lisp as a structured macro-processor, but soon I
realised it was much more.

## Where did your road originate?

Well I was a heavy user of character based macro-processors for code
generation (e.g. GPM, m4).  I found them great but excrutiating to
debug and to write code with any structure.  There had to be a better
way, and then I was introduced to Lisp...a programmer's koan.

## How far have you gotten in your study of Lisp?

Soon after I stumbled into Lisp I decided to write my own. I found a
paper which made it look simple

```
Timothy P. Hart and Thomas G. Evans, "Notes on
Implementing Lisp for the M-460 Computer", in
"THE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE Lisp: Its Operation and
Applications", Information International Inc.
March 1964.
```

Ever since then I have spent more time hacking C and C++ inside my
interpreter than writing good Lisp code. (Greenspun's Tenth Rule of
Programming: "Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program
contains an ad-hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow
implementation of half of Common Lisp." Which accurately sums up my
interpeter.) In doing so I have studied a lot of material and learned
huge amounts about Lisp. In hindsight I wish I had spent more time
coding in someone elses Lisp. However I should like to add the
following maxim:

```
"Even an ad-hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden,
slow implementation of half of Common Lisp
is better than most other languages."
```

In my own Lisp I write demo web apps bring to life proposals for work
collegues. Because I'm using Lisp, it's easy to hack-a-demo in my
lunch breaks. In the past I've used Lisp to solve problems for
collegues which have been 'too difficult' in ordinary languages. I
guess I'm like many Lisp users - we use Lisp in the background to
support production but Lisp never gets used in frontline production
applications.

## What do you think of Lisp so far?

I just wish that the CL implementations available would do everything
I want to do for free. Decent Lisp costs big bucks. Therefore I keep
adding to [my own Lisp
interpreter](http://www.ozemail.com.au/~birchb/reflisp/index.html). It
now has an embedded web server, Lisp Server Pages, SQL database, XML
parser etc.. so I can write web apps.

The Lisp literature and its community are usually years ahead of the
pack. Most language features I have ever seen are already in
Lisp. Lisp allows me to play with ideas so quickly.  Lisp continues to
do it for me. Yes!
