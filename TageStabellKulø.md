## When did you first try Lisp seriously, and which Lisp family member was it?

CMUCL, 2002

## What led you to try Lisp?

After having searched a missing `free()` once too often, I seached for
a better language and found Java as a result of hype in media, but
after having typed 'public static void main' once too often, I
searched for a better language and found Python as a result of having
met Guido, but after having seached for a missing indentation once too
often, I found Lisp as a result of having read PAIP.

I've used emacs for 15 years and share nationality (and hence local
newsgroups) with Erik Naggum, so I have 'seen' Lisp many times.  But
it was a friend whom I admire for his programming skills that
persuaded me to bring PAIP as the only book on a month-long vacation
in Christmas i 2001.

## Where did your road originate?

Prototyping for research.

## How far have you gotten in your study of Lisp?

Far enough to be convinced that what I can implement is restricted by
my abilities rather than the language and its runtime.

## What do you think of Lisp so far?

The flexibility in all dimensions at times overwhelms me; I probably
need to work harder.
