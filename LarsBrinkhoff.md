I tried [Emacs Lisp](http://cliki.net/elisp) in 1996, and started
writing a medium-sized program.  Unfortunately, it mostly felt like I
was trying to write [C](http://cliki.net/C) code in Lisp, and
enlightenment never appeared.

However, I still had a feeling I was missing out on something, and in
particular I remembered being impressed with how quickly a friend of
mine had written a Lisp program to create 3D animations for a LED
display.  So I bought [CLtL2](http://cliki.net/CLtL2) in case I'd get
an urge to learn more about Lisp.

Then, in early 2001, I read [Paul Graham](http://cliki.net/Paul
Graham)'s ["Beating the Averages"](http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html)
and once again became curious.  I started reading CLtL2, and even
though the basics were familiar from Emacs Lisp, I was amazed at the
richness of the language.

I have now finished [PAIP](http://cliki.net/PAIP), Graham's "ANSI
Common Lisp" and [On Lisp](http://cliki.net/On Lisp), Keene's
"Object-Oriented Programming in COMMON LISP" and some more [Lisp
books](http://cliki.net/Lisp books).  I've yet to write more than
small snippets of code, but I now have a few interesting ideas to try
out in Lisp.
