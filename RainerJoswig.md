## When did you first try Lisp seriously, and which Lisp family member was it?

My first contacts with Lisp: Apple II Lisp in ca. 1982. Then
MacScheme, UCI Lisp, Coral Lisp, Symbolics Genera... Many of them at
the University of Hamburg. The University had a lot of Lisp
environments to learn from (also Allegro CL, LispWorks, Xerox
InterLisp-D, ...).

I really liked MacScheme and used it to explore algorithms.

## What led you to try Lisp?

I did like the interactive nature and the nice environments.

## Where did your road originate?

Before Lisp I learned languages like some assemblers (6502, VAX, ...),
Basic, Pascal and Modula 2.

## How far have you gotten in your study of Lisp?

Far enough to have some Lisp Machines (MacIvory 3, NXP 1000, ...) at
home. Currently my favorite is LispWorks on my PowerBook. I also like
CL-HTTP.

I also have used Lisp in some commercial projects.

## What do you think of Lisp so far?

I'm using it.
