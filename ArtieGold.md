## When did you first try Lisp (meaning here and throughout the survey "any member of the Lisp family") seriously, and which Lisp family member was it?

My first attempt at LISP was during an abortive attempt at graduate
school (UCLA) in 1978, in an AI course. It made no sense to me at that
time (nor did much else). My second attempt came in 1995, in a
`Symbolic Computation' course at UTexas. As I was getting involved in
pure, lazy functional languages at the time, it **still** made no sense
to me. In 1996, as a result of sitting in on a graduate programming
languages course (UT) I started playing with Scheme -- and started to
like it.

Now that I'm about to start a new career as a stay-at-home Dad (that's
what happens when you're unintentionally unemployed [insert comments
about local tech bust here]) I need something to learn; having largely
gotten over my `religious' objections to CL (separate namespaces,
impurity, sheer size) it seems like time!

## What led you to try Lisp?

Well, it was a course requirement. ;-)

Robert Strandh also finally wore me down...

## If you were trying Lisp out of unhappiness with another language, what was that other language and what did you not like about it, or what were you hoping to find different in Lisp?

Well, once you see closures (which I actually first used in Burroughs
ALGOL lo these many years ago) you don't want to go back! (At my last
paying gig, writing embedded C, time after time the natural design for
a solution involved closures -- and my colleague's would just give me
a blank stare.)

## How far have you gotten in your study of Lisp? (I know, that is hard to measure)

Not deep, but broad. I understand _how_ things work and _why_, but the
facility of `finding the right incantations' is not there yet.

I know. Practice. Practice.

## What do you think of Lisp so far?

It's a tool -- or, perhaps, many tools. A great big ugly swiss army
knife.  But, as any tool, used artfully it can produce beautiful
things.
